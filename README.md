# Bangla OCR
### Description
This project started with an aim to convert bangla handwritten images to text, i.e digitize the handwritten documents. Due to inadequate amount of data for handwritten words we started the experiment with printed word images. After that we moved on to work with  handwritten word images by synthetically generating them.  


This project takes inspiration from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05717) paper for the model and [this](https://github.com/meijieru/crnn.pytorch) repo for code.
